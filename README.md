# Frequent-Item-Set-Mining-For-Market-Basket-Analysis

Frequent item mining is a crucial task in data mining, which involves identifying sets of items that frequently appear together in a given dataset.

By identifying frequent itemsets, or sets of items that frequently appear together in a given dataset, frequent item mining enables the analysis of market baskets, web clickstreams, and other data sources that exhibit transactional behavior.

These frequent itemsets can then be used to derive valuable insights and knowledge from the data, such as identifying association rules, recommending products, and predicting customer behavior.

In this paper, we provide an overview of frequent item mining, including its definition, importance, and various algorithms. We focus on two popular algorithms for frequent item mining, Apriori and FP-Growth, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
